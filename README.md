## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   <code> git clone <repository-url> </code>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   <code> cd fenerbahce-ecommerce</code>

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   <code> npm install</code>

4. Start the development server:

   <code> npm start</code>

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own. You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
